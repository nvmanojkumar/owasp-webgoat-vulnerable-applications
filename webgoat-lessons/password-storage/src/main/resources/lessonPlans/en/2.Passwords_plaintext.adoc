= Storing passwords in plaintext

This is the most insecure way to deal with passwords. Let's assume the passwords gets stored in a database, the user creates an account, and a password. All this is stored in a database table called `users` like:

|===
|username | name | password

|jdoe| John Doe | password
|alice | Alice | 1234567
|bob | Bob | qwerty
|steve01 | Steve | r1cOHG7rf/3YQuFNtl7Lzg==
|===


The problem with this approach is that if the database gets breached during for example with an SQL injection the plaintext passwords are visible for the attacker. You also have to think about internal employees with direct access to the database who can steal or change the passwords of the users.
